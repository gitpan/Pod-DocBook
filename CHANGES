0.0.5
=====

    o Added an incremental fix from Pod::HTML which corrected bogus output
      in C<0>, B<0> and so on tags.

0.0.4
=====

    o Added handling for auto-tag generation

0.0.3
=====

    o POD files such as:

        =head1 Some Chapter Title

        blah

      will format the first =head1 tag as a <chapter> tag and automatically
      fill in the final </chapter> for you when run with --no-header and
      --no-footer

    o =over/=item/=back handling cleaned up a bit to produce correct
      <variablelist>, <orderedList> and <itemizedList> constructs

    o Added basic auto-tagging handling.

    o Added --root-id argument to specify the root tag id

    o Removed <A> tags which were an overhang from pod2html
